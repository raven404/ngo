                    <p style="text-align: justify"> Passion Movement International was founded in Delhi, India by medical Dr. Peter and Heather Malakar with a vision to develop and challenge potential leaders around the world for a life of integrity, hope and compassionate service.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"></p> PMI brings people together from different places to share expertise and resources, while developing friendships and seeking new opportunities to serve together for LOCAL and GLOBAL impact. We seek to identify the areas of need
                    around us and endeavor to meet them with not only immediate but long-term assistance. This includes social, educational, spiritual and charitable work.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"> INTEGRITY, EXCELLENCE,COMMITMENT & RELATIONSHIP are what PMI considers as our core values. We are a dedicated group of volunteers and staff with that similar passion and vision. Our phenomenal team would love to meet you and plug you
                        into what is going on at PMI!

                    <p style="text-align: justify" style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif">
                        It has always been PMI’s ambition to create an atmosphere where anyone can connect and feel welcome – a home away from home. Being situated so close to Delhi University has given us the unique opportunity to invest in students lives, and provide ways
                        for them to invest in others.Life in Delhi is full of stresses, opportunities, and decisions so we have made it our passion to encourage, help, and guide students towards a better Since our beginning in 2006 we have seen many people
                        grow and develop their skills, people that are now changing the face of India and even around the world. For instance, several of our volunteers have been selected into Indian Administrative Services. No matter what field of study,
                        age, or nationality, PMI is committed to serve all, and we do so in a variety of ways: ENGLISH COURSES are provided at various times throughout the year with native English speaking teachers for Beginners, Intermediate, and Advance
                        courses.
                        <p style="text-align: justify"> Please check our website for the upcoming courses. MUSIC CLASSES and TAE-KWON-DO classes are also open to all people throughout the year. VISION PROJECT: PMI also works with visually challenged students. We don’t believe them to
                            be “disabled,” but rather, that God has created them “differently-abled”. We encourage them in different areas of life and treat them as one among us without any difference. CLOTHING & BLANKET DISTRIBUTION: On a regular basis
                            donated clothes are given to help the needy slum families.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">Every winter PMI collects blankets to distribute, at random, to the people on the streets of Delhi. Other Activities: PMI holds music concerts and seminars with a variety of topics. The musicians and speakers come from both India
                            and abroad. We also put on Kids Camps and carnivals for the community and slum kids. In addition, students will find a Fresher’s program available, and opportunities to share their talents during our weekly programs.</p> Internship:
                        Students from both India and Foreign universities apply for internship with PMI Medical Consultancy (by appointment): Doctors are available to provide medical assistance and medicines as needed. Please contact us, we offer our
                        service free of charge. Counseling (by appointment): Student Life in Delhi can be very challenging and living in a city of 20 million can be troublesome. Professional counselors are here to help you deal with the various issues
                        of life. We respect your privacy, feel free to contact us. Counseling is free of charge..
